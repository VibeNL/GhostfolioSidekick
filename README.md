# GhostfolioSidekick

A continuous running Docker container (A sidecar) to automatically import files from several brokers & crypto exchanges. The program checks every hour if any new transactions are found and inserts them in [ghostfolio](https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio). It can also correct & remove transactions in case they have changed (for example a different exchange rate) or the source file was deleted.

( more to come? Help is always welcome! )

## Setup

### Ghostfolio
* Create an account in ghostfolio using anonymous option save your **KEY**.

### Folder structure

FileImporterPath should point to a folder with the following structure:
 * Account Name
   * File1.csv
 * Account Name 2
   * File2.csv

Assuming you configured an account with the name 'Trading 212' and an account with 'De Giro' in ghostfolio, the following structure should be used.
For example:
* Trading 212
  * Export2023.csv
* De Giro
  * Export2022.csv
  * Export2023.csv

### Mapping File
